# custom-emoji-extension

Add and view your own custom emoji across webpages

## Goal

- Add emoji
- Store in database as :emoji:
- When any web page loads, render all :emoji: as the actual emoji image

## Stretch Goals

- Delete old emojis
- Search bar for emoji
- Options popup that allows you to standardize emojis (choose from Apple, Google, Facebook, EmojiOne)
- Clear database after 30ish days to make the app more optimal for more users

## Challenges
- Getting it to work for Gmail (extension doesn't search through the DOM -- why???)
- Getting it work as you continue scrolling (i.e., for Facebook news feed)
